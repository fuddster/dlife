Things to fix:
  - Carb adding in scenario 3 (carbs from timer)
  - Delayed carbs applied dispite simulation being paused (scenario 3)
  - EvalAbove and EvalBelow switched?  (test and fix)
  x Fix Negative Numbers when given too much insulin; don't let BG go below 0 (Fixed, SE + EE, 6/27/17)
  - setDelay doesn't work (See bolus2-carbs.html)
  - drift seems too small (see drift_test.html) -  set at 60 only drifts one per 5 ticks, should be (0-5 per tick)
  - check other functions for empty parameters and throw errors or set default and print warning (model addcarbsWithImpact())

Things to add:
  - Different sugar types (quick, normal, fat based)
  x Display I:C ratio on screen (Added, SE + EE, 6/27/17)
  - New goals
      - Not Above - Fail if you go above x
    - Not Below - Fail if you go below x
  - Display drift value Toggle

Ideas:
  - Predictions (3 directions - one with insulin; carbs and combined; too much carbs middle line goes up; too little line goes down, etc)
  - Side graph of insulin/carb impact
  - Pull nightscout data
    - Do simulations of current data
    - Compare reality with simulation?
  - Add basels
  - Better completion congratulations
  - Link together
    - Either separate index page
    - Or in the congratulations message
  - Allow customization of personal settings (isf/i:c/basels)

Scenarios to add:
